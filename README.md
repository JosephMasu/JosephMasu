### Hi there 👋, my name is Masu Joseph,

I'm a Fullstack Engineer with expertise in both Web2 and Web3 development. I specialize in building responsive, scalable web applications and decentralized apps(dApps) using modern frontend technologies and robust backend frameworks like
NestJS and MongoDB. Passionate about crafting intuitive user interfaces and architecting secure, high-performance backend systems, I bring end-to-end development experience across traditional and blockchain-based projects.

I’m a dynamic and driven mobile App developer;
On the mobile front, I build robust and intuitive Android applications that cater to user needs. My experience covers:

Skills: HTML | CSS | React.js | ReactNative | Next.js | TailwindCSS | JavaScript | TypeScript | Java | Firebase | Supabase | MongoDb.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on front-end development for Web2, and creating dApps that integrate blockchain technology for Web3
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SpringBoot
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Web2 and Web3 projects
  
- 💬 Ask me about HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Next.js. 

💡Let's build the future together!
